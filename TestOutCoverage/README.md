TestOutCoverage
===============

There are multiple workflows for developing, testing, and checking coverage. Below is a simple example.


Example Workflow:
--------

1.) Build the sample app TestOutCoverage in XCode 5.

2.) Run unit tests (individually or all) from XCode 5.

3.) Launch CoverStory and open the derived data /build path. (i.e., /Users/xxxxx/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TestOutCoverage-dcfsrtapnwdxckbtgeodhukifmvq/Build/)

4.) CoverStory should be reporting coverage on your model classes. (If you see coverage on your test files you can set the filters in CoverStory to hide them.)

5.) Load and run the sample DepositMoney.js in Instruments.

8.) Refresh CoverStory and view the cummulative coverage results.
